# What is LFG Perp?

**LFG Perp** is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange built on Oraichain, enabling traders to gain leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets without expiration dates.

## Overview

Perpetual futures (perps) are derivative contracts that allow you to speculate on the future price of an asset with leverage, but unlike traditional futures, they never expire. LFG Perp brings this powerful trading instrument to the decentralized world with:

- **Non-custodial trading**: You maintain full control of your private keys and funds
- **High leverage**: Access leveraged positions on major cryptocurrencies
- **No expiration**: Positions remain open indefinitely until you close them
- **Funding rates**: Market-driven mechanism to keep perpetual prices anchored to spot prices
- **On-chain settlement**: All trades settled transparently on Oraichain

<Note>
  LFG Perp is built on Oraichain, a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain, ensuring fast
  finality, low costs, and robust security.

## How Perpetual Futures Work

### Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Perpetual Contracts" icon="infinity">
    Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, perpetual contracts can be held indefinitely. This makes them ideal for:
    - Long-term position building
    - Flexible trading strategies
    - Avoiding rollover costs
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Leverage" icon="arrows-maximize">
  Control a large position with a small amount of collateral. For example, with
  10x leverage: - Deposit $1,000 USDC - Control a $10,000 position - Amplified
  gains **and** losses
  <Warning>
    Higher leverage increases liquidation risk. Always monitor your margin
    ratio.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Funding Rates" icon="percent">
  Periodic payments between longs and shorts to keep perpetual prices aligned
  with spot prices: - **Positive funding**: Longs pay shorts (bullish market) -
  **Negative funding**: Shorts pay longs (bearish market) - **Calculated every 1
  hour** based on price deviation
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collateral & Margin" icon="shield">
    Your USDC collateral secures your position:
    - **Initial margin**: Required to open a position
    - **Maintenance margin**: Minimum to keep position open
    - **Free collateral**: Available for new positions
    - **Liquidation**: Triggered if margin falls too low
  </Accordion>
